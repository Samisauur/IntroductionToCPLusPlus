// Program: Copies the data from an input file to an outputfile "88_mph"
//          so that it is formatted the same in both files. Additionally, it
//          adds 50 to the year in the output file to help Marty Mcfly get back to his proper time
// Created: 11/28/2023
// Pre:     88_mph file exists
// Post:    Creates a new file that will state the year Marty McFly should head back to
